# The Next.js Rehab Program

As indie hackers, we love going live quickly. But quick fixes, borrowed code, and "battery-included" solutions can lead to a maintenance nightmare, especially when youâ€™re just tweaking things without full understanding. And we have a solution for you!

## Essential Tools for Every Next.js Project

No matter if it's a web2 or web3 project, these tools are essential for maintaining code quality, performance, and overall project stability.

- ESLint (with plugins): Ensures your code follows best practices.
- Prettier: For consistent code formatting.
- Husky: Automates Git hooks.
- Knip: Helps track unused files and exports.
- Cross-env: Manages environment variables across platforms.
- Jest: A must for testing.
- Zod: For schema validation.
- Sharp: Image optimization.
- next/bundle-analyzer: Optimizes bundle size.
- Sentry: Error tracking.

## Additional Tools for Workflow Optimization

These tools aren't specific to Next.js but are crucial for overall workflow and project management.

- EditorConfig: Maintains consistent coding styles.
- Makefile: Simplifies common tasks.
- Docker: For consistent development environments.
- Codespell: Catches typos in your code.
- GitHub Actions: Automates testing and deployment pipelines.
